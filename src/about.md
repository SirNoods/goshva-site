# About Me
Hi again, I'm Josh (he/him), a curious human currently based in Leipzig who somehow ended up animating, scripting and making games. 

I started in 3D and VFX, spent years wrangling renders and solving production puzzles, and somewhere along the way discovered that writing Python felt a lot more like home than animating my way through the industry.

Outside of work, I tinker with **music**, build **small games**, and sometimes spend way too long configuring my **Linux setup**.

I like projects that mix art, code, and a bit of chaos — the kind where the process is just as fun as the result.
