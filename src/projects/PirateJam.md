# Antibody

**Antibody** is a barely researched little game about the immune system — created as both a **learning experiment** for myself and an **entry for Pirate Software Jam 16**.

## What it is  
A simple 2D game where you control antibodies defending the body from invading pathogens.  
I built it in **Godot 4** during the jam, mainly to experiment with physics-based interactions, projectiles, and tight iteration loops under a strict deadline.

The idea: what if you could represent the immune system as a chaotic shooter not particularly accurate, but **fun**, fast, and reactive?

It isn't polished, it's messy, and I don't believe I currently have a working build online to link toward. 

## What I learned  
This was my first game in general, and my first gamejam. It taught me a ton about:  
- Working under time constraints and the importance of planning ahead
- Structuring a small Godot project
- Pixel Art 
- Thinking outside the box for mechanics or weird issues
- Accepting imperfection: it doesn’t have to be scientifically correct to be entertaining. 

## Here's some footage I found:

Playing around with _way_ too many projectiles as physical objects in the scene.

More polished, and including more assets, and with an actual enemy trying to get you!

## Notes  
It’s scrappy, messy, and a bit silly — but it was an incredibly fun way to learn.  
The jam theme encouraged rapid prototyping, and I would quite like to revisit the idea, with some better planning, my newer skills and perhaps even slightly more research into immunology.
