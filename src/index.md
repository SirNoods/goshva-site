# Hello there.

I'm **Joshua Schmidt**, Josh for short — a creative mind and nerd of many things, mainly fueled by caffeine and curiosity.

I've worked on **feature films** in a professional capacity, am building my first **game**, and tinker around with **music production**.  
My background in **VFX** taught me precision and discipline; my love of **games and all things nerdy** keeps me experimental and playful.

## What I Do

- 🎬 **VFX & Film:** Experience across multiple major productions. [IMDb Profile](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm15078878/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1)
- 🧙‍♂️ **Game Project:** Creator of my little passion project, *Spellbrawl*
- 🎧 **Music & Sound:** Composing and producing music in FL Studio
- 💻 **Creative Tech:** Coding tools, this website, and scattering bits of art across my hard drives

---

## Currently

I'm looking for opportunities in **technology** and **software development**, where I can bring my creative problem-solving, technical mindset, and cross-disciplinary experience to build meaningful systems and tools.

### Side Note

This site is my ongoing experiment — built by hand using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). 
It grows, mutates, and occasionally crashes (as all good experiments do).
